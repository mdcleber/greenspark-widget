# Overview

This project is based on a task provided by Greenspark.
Requirements can be found [here](/docs/Greenspark%20-%20Frontend%20Task-1.pdf) and prototype [here](#prototypes)

This project was developed using React, Typescript and CSS.

## Possible improvements
- Internationalization: Currently is not supported and is available only the default language.
- Accessibility: I belive some readers will fail to indentify some custom components, more tests should be done to guaranty that the site is accesible.
- Unit Test: There is some unit tests, but more could be added to ensure the quality.
